     <h2>Hop on the Astoria bound N or W and let's get started!</h2>

       <p class="border light-blue">The N or W trains are a staple of Astoria. They can be easily accessed all throughout the city, including from 34th and Harold Square, Bryant Park, World Trade Center and Queensboro Plaza. If you aren't familiar with the subway system, the N and W are the yellow trains! Click on the image below to get a better look!</p>

       <h2>Summertime (and the living's easy)</h2>
            <img class="large-image" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/arts/13summerinthecity-print/merlin_141160920_4cf323ee-5e91-4c06-9fef-65d78e7911ac-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale" height="320px" width="320">
            <p class="border light-blue">By far, my favorite thing about Astoria is the park. I could say that I look forward to summer, and that would be true primarily because of my love for Astoria's pool. While the park is magical year-round, summer is when it really sparkles. Relaxing by the pool, music from the ice cream truck, the smell of barbecue, and the eager gathering around the italian ice stand encapsulate the vibe of an Astorian summer perfectly. </p>

            <p class="border light-blue">A perfect season can be spent laying out by the pool with your favorite book in the morning, followed by hanging a hammock in the park in the afternoon watching all the activities around you: the beautiful and abundant parade of happy puppies, the kites flying in the sky, the never ending games of ball. This is best followed by a leisurely bike ride down to Compton's for an incredible sandwich from a local wonder, and maybe a stop at Astoria library on the way back. Is there anything much sweeter?</p>

            <p class="border light-blue">The answer is "hold my bike". Depending on how your day looks, imagine all of that paired with an afternoon take-away Margarita. Head to Cafe Jardin de Cuba on 30th for a sneaky drinky to carry back for your Astoria Park evening session. There's almost always something exciting going on in the summer evenings at Astoria Park. You could be in for fireworks over the river, a movie under the stars, or possibly one of the park's summer Jazz Nights.</p>

            <p class="border light-blue"> Check out this short video on Astoria below for a peek into the park, my neighborhood: Ditmars, New York's oldest beerhall:Bohemian Beergarten (one of my favorite spots!) and more! They even found the ice cream trucks! There are ads occasionally in the video: just skip through them!</p>
